# Todo App - Implementation Notes

## Development Timeline & Decisions

### Phase 1: Project Structure Setup
- Created monorepo structure with clear separation of concerns
- Established OpenAPI-first approach for API contract
- Set up proper directory structure following best practices

### Phase 2: Backend Implementation
- **Technology Choice**: Go was selected for performance and simplicity
- **Architecture**: Simple RESTful API with in-memory storage
- **Packages Used**:
  - `gorilla/mux` for HTTP routing
  - `google/uuid` for unique identifiers
  - `rs/cors` for cross-origin support

### Phase 3: Frontend Implementation  
- **Technology Choice**: React with TypeScript for type safety
- **UI Framework**: Material-UI for consistent design language
- **State Management**: React hooks for local state
- **API Integration**: Axios with generated TypeScript types

### Phase 4: Infrastructure Design
- **Cloud Provider**: AWS for reliability and scalability
- **Container Strategy**: ECS Fargate for serverless containers
- **Networking**: VPC with public/private subnet separation
- **Load Balancing**: Application Load Balancer with path-based routing

## Key Architectural Decisions

### API Design
- **OpenAPI Specification**: Single source of truth for API contract
- **RESTful Endpoints**: Standard HTTP methods for CRUD operations
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error response format
- **Pagination**: Offset-based pagination for scalability

### Frontend Architecture
- **Component Structure**: Separation of presentation and logic
- **Type Safety**: Generated types from OpenAPI specification
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages and loading states
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Material-UI

### Infrastructure Choices
- **Containerization**: Docker-ready applications
- **Scalability**: Auto-scaling ECS services
- **Security**: Private subnets for application services
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch integration for observability

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Advanced filtering and search
- [ ] Task scheduling and reminders
- [ ] Collaboration features

## Security Considerations

### Current Implementation
- CORS configuration for frontend integration
- Input validation for API endpoints
- UUID-based identifiers to prevent enumeration

### Recommended Improvements
- JWT-based authentication
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- Input sanitization and validation
- HTTPS enforcement
- Database connection encryption
- Secrets management for sensitive configuration

## Performance Considerations

### Current Implementation
- In-memory storage for fast access
- Pagination to limit response sizes
- Optimized React components with proper key usage

### Scaling Strategies
- Database connection pooling
- API response caching
- CDN for static assets
- Horizontal scaling with load balancers
- Database read replicas

## Development Workflow

### Code Organization
- Clear separation between frontend, backend, and infrastructure
- Consistent naming conventions across all components
- Comprehensive documentation for each module

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for user workflows
- Infrastructure validation with Terraform

### Deployment Process
- Environment-specific configurations
- Blue-green deployments for zero downtime
- Automated rollback capabilities
- Health checks for service validation
